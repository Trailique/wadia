      Apples are round, edible fruits that come from apple trees. They are a
      member of the rose family (Rosaceae) and are grown around the world.
      Apples are a good source of fiber, vitamin C, and antioxidants. They are
      also low in calories and can be filling. Apples are primarily grown for
      fresh consumption, but they are also used to make vinegar, juice, jelly,
      applesauce, and apple butter. They can also be canned for use in pies.
      Apples can be a dark red color, like the Red Delicious variety, which is
      high in antioxidants. Antioxidants can help neutralize free radicals in
      the body, which can cause cell damage and lead to disease. Apples can be
      part of a healthy diet, and some say that eating one or two apples a day
      is beneficial for most people.
