<meta> tag:


The <meta> tag in HTML is used to provide metadata about the HTML document.
 Metadata is information about the HTML document itself, rather than the content within it. 
 This information can include things like character encoding, viewport settings for responsive design, authorship details, keywords for search engines, and more.

 <meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

name and content: Used together to specify various types of metadata. The name attribute defines the type of metadata, while the content 

attribute provides the actual value.

viewport: Specifies the viewport settings for responsive web design, controlling how the webpage is displayed on different devices.
