The <meta> tag in HTML is used to provide metadata about the HTML document. 
Metadata is information about the data within the document, and it is not displayed on the web page itself.
Instead, it offers additional information to browsers, search engines, and other web services.
<meta> tags are typically placed within the <head> section of an HTML document.
