The
<meta> tag in HTML is used to provide metadata about the HTML document. Metadata is data about data, providing
information about the HTML document itself rather than its content.
<meta> tags are placed within the

<head> element of an HTML document.

    Here are some common purposes of the
    <meta> tag:

    Setting Character Encoding: The
    <meta> tag can specify the character encoding used by the HTML document.
    This is important for ensuring that special characters and symbols are displayed correctly in the browser.

    Defining Viewport for Responsive Design: In the context of mobile web development, the
    <meta> tag can define the viewport settings to control how the webpage is displayed on different devices and screen
    sizes.

    Providing Metadata for Search Engines and Social Media:
    <meta> tags can include metadata such as description, keywords, author, and other information that helps search
    engines understand and index the content of the webpage. They are also used for specifying social media metadata
    like title, description, and image to optimize how the page appears when shared on social media platforms.

    Here's an example of how the
    <meta> tag is used to specify the character encoding and define the viewport for a webpage:

    html

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">

    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Example Page</title>
    </head>

<body>
    <!-- Content of the webpage goes here -->
</body>

</html>
In this example:

<meta charset="UTF-8"> specifies that the character encoding of the document is UTF-8, which supports a wide range of
characters from various languages and symbols.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> sets the viewport width to the device width and
sets the initial zoom level to 1.0, ensuring that the webpage is rendered properly on different devices and screen
sizes.
