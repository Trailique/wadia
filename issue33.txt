#List and explain commanly used HTML elements
1.<p>: The
<p> element is used to define a paragraph in HTML.
    Browsers typically add some space above and below a paragraph by default to visually separate it from other content
    on the page.
    eg:
<p>This is a paragraph </p>


2.<a>: The <a> element, short for anchor, is used to create hyperlinks in HTML.
        It allows you to link to other web pages, files, locations within the same page, email addresses, and more.
        eg:<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example Website</a>


        3.<img>: The <img> element is used to embed images in an HTML document. It is a self-closing tag and does not
        have a closing tag.
        The src attribute specifies the URL of the image, and the alt attribute provides alternative text for the image,
        which is displayed if the image cannot be loaded or by screen readers for accessibility.
        eg:<img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful sunset">

        4.<div>: The <div> element is a generic container used to group together other HTML elements and apply styling
                or JavaScript functionality to them.
                It is a block-level element and does not have any semantic meaning on its own.
                eg:<div>
                    <p>This is inside a div element.</p>
                    <img src="image.jpg" alt="An image inside a div">
                </div>

                5.<form>: The <form> element is used to create HTML forms for user input. It can contain various input
                        elements like text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.

                        Eg:<form>
                            <!-- Form elements go here -->
                        </form>
