In CSS, specificity refers to the rules that determine which style declarations are applied to elements. It defines the priority or weight of different CSS rules when multiple rules apply to the same element.

The specificity of a CSS selector is determined by the combination of the type of selector, class selectors, ID selectors, and inline styles. Specificity is often represented as a four-part value, commonly referred to as specificity points:

Inline Styles: Inline styles have the highest specificity. They are applied directly to the element using the style attribute.

ID Selectors: ID selectors have higher specificity than class selectors and element selectors. They are denoted by the # symbol followed by the ID name.

Class Selectors, Attribute Selectors, and Pseudo-Classes: These selectors have lower specificity than ID selectors. They target elements based on their class, attributes, or pseudo-classes like :hover, :active, etc.

Element Selectors: Element selectors have the lowest specificity. They target HTML elements directly using tag names like div, p, a, etc.

When multiple CSS rules conflict, the browser calculates specificity to determine which rule to apply. If two rules have equal specificity, the one that appears later in the CSS document will take precedence.

Here's an example to illustrate specificity:

html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">

    <title>CSS Specificity Example</title>
    <style>
        /* Rule 1: Specificity - 0 0 1 0 */
        div {
            color: blue;
        }

        /* Rule 2: Specificity - 0 1 0 0 */
        .container p {
            color: green;
        }

        /* Rule 3: Specificity - 0 0 0 1 */
        #unique p {
            color: red;
        }

        /* Rule 4: Specificity - 1 0 0 0 */
        body p {
            color: orange;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container" id="unique">
        <p>This is a paragraph inside a div with class "container" and id "unique".</p>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
In this example:

The paragraph inside the <div> element with class "container" and id "unique" will have red color because the selector #unique p has the highest specificity.
Even though there are other selectors that target the <p> element, the specificity of #unique p takes precedence over the other rules.
