new features introduced in HTML5.
Semantic Elements:
HTML5 introduced new semantic elements that provide better structure and meaning to web documents. Examples include <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <footer>, <aside>, <main>, <figure>, <figcaption>, <time>, <details>, <summary>, etc.
 These elements help developers create clearer and more accessible markup, making it easier for search engines and assistive technologies to understand the content's structure.

Audio and Video Support:
HTML5 brought native support for embedding audio and video content directly into web pages without the need for third-party plugins like Flash.
The <audio> and <video> elements allow developers to embed media files (such as MP3, Ogg, WebM) directly into the page, making it easier to create multimedia-rich experiences while ensuring compatibility across different devices and platforms.

Canvas and SVG Graphics:
HTML5 introduced the <canvas> element, which provides a drawing surface for dynamic rendering of graphics, charts, animations, and interactive content using JavaScript. 
It allows developers to create complex visualizations and interactive applications directly within the browser without relying on external plugins.
 Additionally, HTML5 includes native support for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), which enables the creation of resolution-independent graphics and illustrations directly within the HTML document, enhancing the flexibility and performance of web applications.
