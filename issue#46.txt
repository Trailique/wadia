In CSS, both the #id and .class selectors are used to target and style HTML elements, but they have some key differences:

#id Selector:

The #id selector is used to select a specific HTML element with a unique identifier (id) attribute.
The id attribute must be unique within the HTML document. It identifies a single, specific element.
The syntax for the #id selector is #elementId.

#uniqueElement {
  color: blue;
}
<div id="uniqueElement">This element is styled using the #id selector.</div>

class Selector:

The .class selector is used to select and style multiple HTML elements that share the same class attribute.
Multiple elements in the document can have the same class, allowing you to apply a common style to them.
The syntax for the .class selector is .className.
Example:

.commonClass {
  font-size: 16px;
}

<p class="commonClass">This paragraph is styled using the .class selector.</p>
<span class="commonClass">This span is also styled using the .class selector.</span>

Use the #id selector when styling a specific, unique element on the page.
Use the .class selector when styling multiple elements that share a common class.
