Making HTML content more accessible is crucial for ensuring that users with disabilities can access and interact with web content effectively.
Three ways to enhance HTML accessibility:

Use Semantic HTML Elements:
Semantic HTML elements provide structure and meaning to the content, making it easier for screen readers and other assistive technologies to interpret and navigate the webpage. By using elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer>, <section>, <article>, and <aside>, you help convey the document structure and improve accessibility. 
Additionally, using appropriate semantic elements for form inputs, such as <input type="text">, <input type="checkbox">, <input type="radio">, and <select>, ensures that screen readers can properly identify and describe form controls to users.

Provide Descriptive Alt Text for Images:
Adding descriptive alt text to <img> elements enables screen readers to convey the content of images to users who are visually impaired. Alt text should be concise and descriptive, providing relevant information about the purpose or content of the image.
 If an image is purely decorative and doesn't convey meaningful content, you can use an empty alt attribute (alt="") to indicate that the image is decorative and should be ignored by screen readers.

Ensure Keyboard Accessibility:
Many users with disabilities rely on keyboard navigation to interact with web content.
 Therefore, it's essential to ensure that all interactive elements and functionalities on your webpage are accessible via keyboard navigation. 
 This includes providing focus styles for interactive elements like links, buttons, and form controls, ensuring that users can easily identify which element has keyboard focus. 
 You can test keyboard accessibility by navigating through your webpage using only the Tab key and ensuring that all interactive elements are reachable and usable.
