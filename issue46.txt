In CSS, both the #id and .class selectors are used to target and style HTML elements, but they differ in how they select elements.

1)#id Selector:

The #id selector is used to select an element with a specific id attribute value.
It is denoted by a hash symbol (#) followed by the id attribute value of the element you want to target.
IDs must be unique within an HTML document, meaning you should only have one element with a specific ID value.
Example: #header { color: blue; } would select the element with id="header" and apply the specified CSS style to it.

2).class Selector:

The .class selector is used to select elements that have a specific class attribute value.
It is denoted by a period (.) followed by the class name you want to target.
Classes can be applied to multiple elements within an HTML document, allowing for more flexible styling and reusability.
Example: .button { background-color: green; } would select all elements with class="button" and apply the specified CSS style to them.
