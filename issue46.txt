In HTML, both Id and Class are the element selector and are used to identify an element based on the name assign to these parameters. ID and Class selectors are the most widely used element selectors in CSS (HTML).

Differences between #id and .class selectors are:
1. #id selector:
The id selector is used to select the id attribute of an HTML element for selecting a particular element.For an HTML element, the "id" name starts with the symbol '#' followed by a unique name. One important characteristics of the id element is that we can only attach one id selector to an element. Hence, the ID selector is always unique within an HTML page.
Syntax:
#id{
// declarations of CSS
}

Example: If you have an HTML element with the ID attribute set to "uniqueID," you can style it using #uniqueID in CSS as follows-
#uniqueID {
    color: blue;
}

2. .class selector:
In HTML, the "class" selector is used to select an element with a specific class attribute. The class selector starts with a period (.) followed by a class name. Unlike the id selector, we can attach multiple selector to an HTML element. Therefore, the class can be applied many time within a page.Multiple elements can share the same class.The important point to note about the class selector is that the class name must not be started with a number.
Syntax:
.class {
// declarations of CSS
}

Example: If you have HTML elements with the class attribute set to "exampleClass," you can style them using .exampleClass in CSS as follows-
.exampleClass {
    font-size: 16px;
}
